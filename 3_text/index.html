			<p id="myParagraph">While the readers of SRK are generally not the type to make a fighting game purchase based on a review from a major publication, you may still have your own reasons for being interested in what others have to say about the game. 1up’s review tops the list, of course, as it was written by iPlayWinner’s Haunts. This gives it’s voice a lot of weight compared to the other reviews linked below. Gametrailer’s review may be worth a look just because it includes video.</p>
